# Generative-AI-Handbook
生成式AI学习手册：路线图翻译

引言
Introduction

这份文档旨在作为一本手册，帮助学习现代人工智能系统背后的关键概念。鉴于人工智能近期的快速发展，目前还没有一个好的教科书式的资源来快速了解大型语言模型（LLMs）或其他生成模型的最新创新。然而，互联网上散布着大量优秀的解释性资源（博客文章、视频等）。我的目标是将这些“最佳”资源整合成一本类似教科书的呈现方式，它可以作为实现个人与人工智能相关的学习目标的路线图。我希望这将是一个“活文档”，随着新创新和范式的不断出现而更新，并且理想情况下，这份文档也能从社区的输入和贡献中受益。

This document aims to serve as a handbook for learning the key concepts underlying modern artificial intelligence systems. Given the speed of recent development in AI, there really isn’t a good textbook-style source for getting up-to-speed on the latest-and-greatest innovations in LLMs or other generative models, yet there is an abundance of great explainer resources (blog posts, videos, etc.) for these topics scattered across the internet. My goal is to organize the “best” of these resources into a textbook-style presentation, which can serve as a roadmap for filling in the prerequisites towards individual AI-related learning goals. My hope is that this will be a “living document”, to be updated as new innovations and paradigms inevitably emerge, and ideally also a document that can benefit from community input and contribution.

The AI Landscape

自2024年6月以来，ChatGPT由OpenAI发布已经过去了大约18个月，世界开始更加频繁地讨论人工智能。此后发生了许多事情：像Meta和Google这样的科技巨头发布了自己的大型语言模型，像Mistral和Anthropic这样的新兴组织也证明了它们是真正的竞争者；无数的初创公司开始在它们的API之上构建产品，每个人都在争夺强大的Nvidia GPU，论文在ArXiv上以惊人的速度出现，演示由LLMs驱动的物理机器人和人工智能程序员的演示在社交媒体上流传，而且看起来聊天机器人正在进入在线生活的各个方面（效果各异）。与此同时，通过扩散模型进行图像生成的快速发展；DALL-E和Midjourney展示了常常让人类在社交媒体上惊叹的越来越令人印象深刻的结果，而且随着Sora、Runway和Pika的进步，高质量视频生成似乎也即将到来。

As of June 2024, it’s been about 18 months since ChatGPT was released by OpenAI and the world started talking a lot more about artificial intelligence. Much has happened since: tech giants like Meta and Google have released large language models of their own, newer organizations like Mistral and Anthropic have proven to be serious contenders as well, innumerable startups have begun building on top of their APIs, everyone is scrambling for powerful Nvidia GPUs, papers appear on ArXiv at a breakneck pace, demos circulate of physical robots and artificial programmers powered by LLMs, and it seems like chatbots are finding their way into all aspects of online life (to varying degrees of success).
